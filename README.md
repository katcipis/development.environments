# Mise en place

```
Mise-en-place is the religion of all good line cooks...
The universe is in order when your station is set up the way you like it:
you know where to find everything with your eyes closed, everything you
need during the course of the shift is at the ready at arm’s reach,
your defenses are deployed.
—Anthony Bourdain

# Install

First of all you need to follow the
[install instructions](https://wiki.archlinux.org/index.php/installation_guide).

DO NOT FORGET to configure locale properly (see the guide) or a lot of odd
shit WILL happen.

The **pre-bootstrap.sh** should be run after you run the base installer
from archlinux but before your restart the machine and boot only your
disk install.

After you reboot you can run **bootstrap.sh** to install all the amazing software
and configure some stuff like locale.
